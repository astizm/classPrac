### Git Branching Tasks - Level One Introductory

Today we went over the basic git branching commands. It's always good to have a refresher for commands that may easily be forgotten over a few weeks without using them. Going over these tasks have helped to cement my knowledge of git branching, merging, commits and also introduced the new command to switch, which is specific command for switching between branches. It also re-introduced rebase, which was not something we used frequently last year.
